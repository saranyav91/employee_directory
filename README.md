Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

Overview
For this assignment, I have created an employee directory with React. The application's UI is divided into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. The deployed applicaton is at https://test-999999978.herokuapp.com/

User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
